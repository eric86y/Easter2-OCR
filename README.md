# Easter2-OCR
A lightweight OCR training pipeline using the Easter2 architecture ([Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14879)). See https://github.com/kartikgill/Easter2 for the original Keras2 implementation.

Note: The current setup is tailored to handle Tibetan input, a more generalized pipeline for common datasets like IAM will follow soon.
